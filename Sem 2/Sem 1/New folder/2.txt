2. Recursion :
	Recursion is the process in which the function calls itself. Some problems can be easily solved by recursion algorithm. The following code snippet shows it.
Eg:
	void fact(int x)
	{
		if(x==0)
			return 1;
		else
			return fact(x-1)*x;
	}
	
	Here the function calls itself based on some condition. When called from main function would give the factorial of the passed value.
